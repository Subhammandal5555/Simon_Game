      <b>How to play this game:</b>
      As this a memorization game, you must have to remember the previous ones' of all the previous levels you have
      completed successfully under a session.
      Here you can see 4 different colored square boxes. Now, if you are going to play the game for the first time in
      your browser you have to click anywhere to start the game. Then it'll work as following :
      <hr>
      <b> Instructions & Functions:</b>
      <br>
      <u>level 1:</u> One of those color boxes will blink and after that within 0.5s you have to
      memorize that colored block which just have been blinked. then just click on it.
      <br> <u>level 2:</u> Same things are gonna happen here also but here within 0.5s you have to memorize the first
      one
      you have clicked and the 2nd one that just blinked. And then you are gonna click on them respectively.<br>
      level 3: Each level has identical procedure except the increment of the memorization of more number of blocks
      with the increment of levels gradually.
      Thus in <u>level n</u>: you have to memorize the previous (n-1) clicks on of which colors' squares and that
      particular
      square's color just blinked in level n; Then click on all those colors' squares respectively otherwise If you do
      any wrong sequence in order of your clicking colors' squares in any level of a particular session , then the game
      will be over and your final level will be your final score for that session.
